论文简介
======

Practically, Synthetic Text Instance(STI) is a widely-used secondary-processed text instance in e–commercial and graphic design. STI are essential for downstream tasks like visual question answering(VQA) and document layout analysis(DLA). However, existing text detection methods retrieve all types of text instances in the image and they cannot specifically detect STI. Moreover, they can also cause misunderstanding and should be removed while keeping the consistency with the background of the image. Therefore, this paper gives a brief definition of STI and proposes a novel special network for synthetic text detection and removal, named STNet. It’s composed of two architectures, i.e., an encoder-decoder structure for image structure reconstruction and synthetic text instance region prediction, and another GAN framework for finer reconstruction. We propose a series of manual benchmarks based on a well-known text detection dataset for synthetic text detection and removal tasks. Extensive experiments of both functions are conducted on the synthesized datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our STNet.
